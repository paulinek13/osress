## About the Repo

It's for all stuff related to new OSRESS website [_**osress.pages.dev**_](https://osress.pages.dev/).
Right now the repo's content, especially documentation, may be kinda messy,
not so well-organized and it certainly lacks importnat information
about the project (website) structure and implementation.

## Development Stack

The OSRESS website is built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS. It generates
static files during the build process, with the website's content
sourced from Markdown files located in the `content` folder.

## One More Thing

Weâ€™ll be testing everything in production for now! Jokes aside,
this is (hopefully) just a temporary solution :)
