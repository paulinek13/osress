## Guidelines

### **Issue Labeling**

Each issue in this project should follow a structured labeling system to ensure
clarity and easy tracking of tasks. By default, every issue
should have **two labels**: one describing the **type of task**
and one identifying the **area it affects**.
Optionally, critical issues can be marked with a priority label.

#### **Mandatory Labels**

- **Task Type**: Specify the nature of the issue:
  - `feat`: A new feature or enhancement.
  - `fix`: A bug that needs to be fixed.
  - `refactor`: An update with no functional changes.
  - `other`: Uncategorized.

- **Area Affected**: Specify the part of the project affected:
  - `ui`: Related to UX/UI.
  - `content`: Related to the website's content.
  - `docs`: Related to the documentation.
  - `source`: Related to the website's source code.

#### **Optional Labels**

- `CRITICAL`: For issues that must be resolved as soon as possible.

By following this system, the workflow remains organized
